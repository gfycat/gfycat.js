Embed script to generate gfycat embeds on 3rd party websites.

The intent of this Javascript file is to provide a simple way for web publishers to include Gfycat embeds on their websites.

This code is provided on Github, so users can request changes, contribute code, or fork a branch. Please contribute to the project to help improve it with actual real world needs.  

###Usage:  

**Include this script on your website**

      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://assets.gfycat.com/gfycat.js"></script>

**Include an embed tag(s)**

Example:

    <div class="gfyitem" data-title=true data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-id="BestYellowishElephantseal"></div>

**The options are:**
* `data-id`: the Gfycat id (required)
* `data-controls`: include controls for pause/speed/etc (default: false)
* `data-title`: show the title on hover (default: false)
* `data-autoplay`: automatically start playback on page load (default: true)
* `data-expand` (DEPRECATED, please use `data-responsive`): expand video element to fill the space of its container (default: false)
* `data-responsive`: expand video element to fill the space of its container (default: false)
* `data-max-height` (works **only** together with `data-responsive=true`): set height upper bound for a responsive video
* `data-optimize`: play videos when they're 50% visible, and lazy loads gifs (default: true)
* `data-gif`: load .gif file instead of video (default: false)

###Source code

The code is broken down into two files:

* **gfyCollection.js**: `gfyCollection` calls `gfyCollection.init()` on page load.  Its function is to find every Gfycat embed on the page and create a gfyObject for it.
* **gfyObject.js**:  a `new gfyObject` instance is created for each gfycat embed.  It contains all of the functions to generate the DOM and manipulate the video.  

`gfyCollection.init` should be called on page load or after `gfyitem` elements appear on the page:  

    if (document.addEventListener) {
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", gfyCollection.init, false);
    } else {
        document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange", gfyCollection.init);
    }

The default key the embed script looks for is `class="gfyitem"`, or the class specificed in `gfyCollection.init('classname')`.

Each instance of `gfyObject` has an `init` method. It's possible to initialize an object with new data.

**html:**
```html
<div class="gfyitem" id="BestYellowishElephantseal"></div>
```

**js:**
```javascript
gfyCollection.init();
var collection = gfyCollection.get();
collection[0].init({id: "BareSecondaryFlamingo"});
```

###Build

```
npm install
gulp build
```

###Testing
`gulp test` - runs all the tests once

`gulp tdd` - watching for file changes and runs all the tests
